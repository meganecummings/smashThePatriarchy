## Project #0 

### Requirements
A README.md file with an explanation of what the project is and why you made it, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable). In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme.

## What is 'Smash The Patriarchy' ??
  It is a game that allows the user to help reduce the patriarchy in our society by clicking away Images or Icons that represent the oppressive control of our Patriarchy. By clicking or 'smashing' the patriarchy images, users are one step closer to smashing the patriarchy. 
  
## Technologies Used... 
I leveraged Bootstrap CSS & jQuery, alongside for loops and randomized asset generation to create an original gameboard upon each user click of the start button! Using Javascript, I was able to maintain over 6 different game screens in a single website - minimizing the impact to processing speed and user-experience delays. 

## Installation Instructions
Simply access from gitHub to click through to the Instructions screen for information about Instructions

## Unsolved Problems
As is, I was unable to get the highScore functionality to work for the game. I'm hoping to add this soon!
